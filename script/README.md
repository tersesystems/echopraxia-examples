# Scripting

This project demonstrates how to use scripts in conditions. 

There are three scripts, `error.tf`, `warn.tf`, and `info.tf`.  You can run the program, and change the conditions in the scripts while the program is running.

The program watches and recompiles the scripts when the files are changed, so you can change the criteria of logging on the fly.
